					<h1>Transformative Leadership Challenge (TLC)</h1>
					<p>During Gateway, I had created a formal challenge for myself. This was the Transformative Leadership Challenge (TLC). Below is the plan I had written out for myself. Unfortunately, I could not my grading for it, but I will keep looking!</p>
					<p><b>Goal: </b>As a leader, I feel that I am great at leading a group, but not so good at being a part of it! I tend to either be the leader of the pack, or somewhere aloof. I think it's a great quality as a leader to be a part of the group; it only makes sense as a leader to be a group member instead of a dictator so that there is open communication amongst the group, efficient planning, and most of all less of a "class" system and more of a unity. </p>
					<p><b>Value: </b>This challenge will allow me to work on a weakness that not only affects me as a leader, but in the rest of my life. It will enhance my leadership leadership as discussed above, where my work with this will allow me to be a more efficient leader. My dynamic will be less of a commander, and more of an organizer. This also makes sense because as a leader, let's say in a manager's position, there isn't enough time to analyze each and every part of a project. There has to be enough trust to allow people to be independent. I think that's why I am generally aloof or a control freak, as I would rather be in control or not be involved whatsoever. This will make a difference in my life as once I can acquire the skillset to depend on other people, I can also improve relationships in my personal and professional life. As for the others' lives, since I aspire to become a manager in some position in an engineering firm, this will be a great opportunity to improve myself for the greater good! </p>
					<p><b>Process/Plan: </b>I have two ideas. My first idea was to get involved in something I know nothing about so that I can learn to be a part of a group while not necessarily directing it. So I auditioned for a hiphop team! I totally have danced a lot in the past, but never this style; I have no knowledge of hiphop, and so I am essentially forcing myself to learn something new as part of a large group. Plus, I get to learn something pretty awesome. My deadlines will just be personal check-ins to see if I am still a "follower" than a "leader."</p> <p>My second idea is to continue my job as Director of Outreach for the Society of Women Engineers. I have served as the Director of Outreach for a semester already, but most of my leadership was planning out every single detail and closely monitoring what each single person was doing. This semester, I am forcing myself to leave more in the hands of the members of the outreach team, where instead of monitoring them I will have them do their own thing and then present at meetings. Plus, I will be able to come up with more outreach events while they are working on already planned things. I'm not really sure honestly where the "deadlines" will be, but if you have any ideas that would be great!</p>
					<p><b>Evaluation Criteria: </b>Did I override anyone else's leadership? Was I considerate of other people's opinions? Did I work efficiently and practically? Did I learn something new? Hip-hop: Did I skip any practices for homework reasons? Outreach: Did I attend enough outreach events and not skip for homework reasons?</p>
					<p><b>Pre-Victory Analysis: </b>My TLC will be a success because I will push myself to do something I struggle with in my daily life, which is being a part of the group other than being an independent bubble. I have always been a contributing member of the group, but I am working on my teamwork skills primarily. My resources will be the awesome peers also attending CU Boulder, and my plan will direct me towards victory since I feel that this will really help me in the long run. Plus, I am being forced out of my homework bubble to socialize a bit; only good can come out of that!</p>
					<p><b>Pre-Mortem Analysis: </b>I would be disappointed because I am generally very introspective as well as critical of my actions. So, in addition to me being this way, if I didn't take this opportunity to really improve something that I've been struggling with for years, I would be very discouraged. I tend to not share these struggles with people, and so if Vanika, the only person whose opinion I listen to, is incapable of finding and making the most of opportunities for self-improvement for Vanika, then there is really no hope. That being said, my biggest obstacle in both of these ideas is going to be myself. For example, I might be discouraged on the hiphop team when I struggle with a new style of hiphop. On the outreach team, I might struggle with depending on others and hence will be tempted to step in.</p>
					<p><b>Reflection: </b>I ended up going with the hip-hop idea, and this was a great experience for me. It really forced me to work on my time management skills and really force myself to be a part of a team. I can't explicitly grade myself as I don't remember exactly how I did, but I do know that I successfully minimized practices missed because of homework.</p>
