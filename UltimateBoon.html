					<h2>Capstone Synthesis </h2>
					<h5>What key insights have you learned through ELP (mentorship, coursework, seminars, leadership experience)? </h5>
					<p>ELP, above all, has given me many skills to be a confident leader within my community. AS ELP can be split into mentorship, coursework, seminars, and leadership experiences, each one of these pillars individually contributed to my passion to be a leader. My mentorship experiences, both as a mentor and a mentee, has allowed me to learn how to teach and be taught. My time as a Toon Leader within the program after having an entire experience through Gateway really gave me a good sense of how to effectively engage and audience and facilitate discussion in such a way that is productive. I was really able to connect with some of the students in my toon and realize that I actually have advice worth giving and experiences worth sharing. Similarly, having a mentor that is just a few years older has really provided me a platform to ask questions and get feedback from someone who is basically an older version of myself. This really made it feel possible to eventually become someone like my mentor, as with a few years of experience I will hopefully be at the same place she is. I think what also made this mentorship really speak to me is that my mentor is openly able to admit the mistakes she made just a few years ago; this made her feel like a relatable/real person, and not some perfect entity I can never become. Mentoring and being mentored provided an application of leadership and learning from one which gave me the confidence to succeed as a leader.</p>
					<p>In regard to coursework, I found that after taking the Greek and Roman Comedy course, I really have a purpose as a leader in engineering. Although the class was mostly about analyzing these comedies to learn about the societies at the time, I really was able to extrapolate a sense of purpose for my field of study from the discussions. I originally took the class to obtain a holistic view of societies outside the technical umbrella I was in after 5 straight semesters of classes, and it really felt like a breath of fresh air to realize that I am where I want to be. Further, in taking School and Society, I found my voice to engage in class discussions and communicate effectively take a position on the issues covered. The issues brought up about progressive vs traditional teaching, racial bias, discrimination, no tolerance policies, etc really hit home. The nature of discussions here made it feel like change is possible, and that I have the tools to do so. Together with a sense of purpose and communicative skills to seize the day, the ELP electives I took really filled me with a sense of confidence to become a leader and my community and really make change. </p>
					<p>In regards to seminars, each speaker provided an insight that affected me as a leader long-term. Jamais Cascio taught me the importance of developing an aptitude to answer difficult ethical questions I will encounter down the line, and to develop the skillset to truly question everything. Danielle Feinberg’s passion for working in lighting at Pixar was incredible; I’ve never seen anyone so passionate about what they do, and she really made me believe that a dream job exists. It was after attending her seminar that I strive to find a contribution to the world as a leader that I can be as passionate about as she is about lighting. John Holdren was the epitome of what a leader in engineering looks like. As a science advisor for the Obama Administration, it was great to see that someone that pursued an undergraduate degree in engineering was able to make so much impact. The biggest insight from here was the significance of science and technology on government policies, and that as a leader the biggest thing that I can do is tell better stories about why science/tech is relevant. Lastly, Dr. Mae Jemison really inspired me to expand my skillset to broad lengths, as “even the sharpest blade can’t cut its own handle” and “you don’t have to choose one [interest], the breadth of knowledge is what matters.” The most powerful part of her discussion was when she boldly said, “I suggest pursuing the extraordinary.” Not only did Dr. Jemison inspire me to broaden my knowledge base, but she also inspired me to try new things! Further, I’ve never heard a women speak so confidently about herself, and I strive to speak about myself in this way.</p>
					<p>Last, but not least, I had the opportunity to apply the time management, communicative, and delegative skills I obtained over the past years of my undergraduate, in addition to the ability to build relationships, solve problems, and take feedback to organize my Leadership Experience. With the support of SWE, I was able to organize two different networking nights (one per semester), with the first as my “trial” round, and the next as the “improved” round. It was clear to see here that I had really gotten good at communication and time-management, but the first time around I was not so good at delegating. The second-time around, I was more specific with what I wanted from those helping and when, and this provided much better results. A key insight I got from this was that I am good at public speaking in technical environments, and this is certainly something I’d like to put into use in the future. Further, I was able to mentor students on preparation for networking nights like this (resumes, elevator pitches, interviews, cover letters), and really found that I enjoyed the experience of teaching others.</p>
					<h5>How have your leadership skills and virtues evolved?</h5>
					<p>As for how my leadership skills and virtues have evolved, I think I didn’t really know what it meant to be a leader until much later down the line. I thought that a leader meant being able to get attention, but really a leader is someone that can make a difference. If anything, I have developed a skillset to take me down the path to make a difference down the line, and hopefully will be able to make an impact on my community.</p>
					<h5>As you embark on your post-graduation plans, how do you intend to utilize the skills, knowledge, virtues, relationships and resources you have fortified in ELP?</h5>
					<p>I hope to start off by becoming a part of any sort of SWE chapter at my future job, and starting off with STEM outreach. I feel very passionate about providing technical opportunities to students at a young age, and would very much like to initiate any kind of work for this utilizing my leadership skills and knowledge of engineering. Further, I would like to utilize my communicative skills to network at my company and move up the food-chain in years to come. In a year, my goal is to either apply for grad schools, apply for an MBA, or move positions in the company I’m in. I’d like to try as much as I can in the next 5 years before settling in a single position. I’d also like to keep a relationship with the ELP program at CU.</p>
					<h5>What constructive feedback do you have for ELP?</h5>
					<p>I think each student should be required to create their own website (not through Google Sites). There are plenty of templates set up, and I think it’s great practice to be able to document experiences within ELP and beyond ELP in a manner that employers can look at. Plus, in the tech world, knowledge of basic coding in form of HTML/CSS is becoming an essential. Further, I think it would be helpful if students were given more structure in their leadership studies in form of the COEN courses. Perhaps ELP may consider making the COEN 3051, COEN 3052, and COEN 3053 core courses of ELP. I’m not sure I’d get as much out of the experience if I hadn’t taken these courses. </p>
					<h5>Do you have advice for future ELPers?</h5>
					<p>For future ELPers, I would advise really taking advantage of the ELP community. There are some really amazing people in the program, and it’s easy to lose connections after Gateway!</p>

					<h3>Personal Leadership Philosophy</h3>
					<h5>Among the rewards for your efforts in ELP should be clarity about your own philosophy of leadership and understanding of yourself as a leader.  While your Capstone Synthesis describes these insights, here articulate a concise stand-alone description of yourself as a leader.  This statement is grounded in ideology (asserting what you believe), self-knowledge (understanding who you are), and conviction (articulating what you intend to do).  This is a good place to reference the philosophy/mission you may have developed in Gateway, as well as your LeaderShape and (for some of you) your “foam head”.</h5>
					<p>I believe that a good leader is one who can lead with due diligence, but also instill the same amount of passion in their team. A good leader needs to be able to earn respect of the teammates, have knowledge of a topic, but also be able to listen and learn from others. They should be flexible, open to feedback, but bold. Lastly, a leader should have a wide knowledge base.</p>
					<p>As a leader, I am great at building relationships with the majority of people on a team which results in instilling passion, but I can’t get myself to get along with those not as passionate to the team goal. I am able to earn respect and learn/listen to others. I am flexible and open to feedback, but need to work on actually taking it into account. I feel like I can be bold when I need to be. At the moment, I feel that my knowledge base is very limited, and I would really like to broaden it.</p>
