					<h1>ELP Mentors </h1>
					<p> Over the course of my ELP career, I've been fortunate enough to get to know Sai Radhakrishnan. 
					After pursuing a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU Boulder, Sai went on to pursue
					Med School. She is currently in her third year of Med School in Houston, Texas. She is originally from Colorado.
					Talking with Sai has been an extremely enlightening experience for me, as she is truly full of so many stories
					and experiences to share. Her passion for mentoring and self-exploration is truly inspring, and it's truly
					been wonderful being her mentee. Below are some documentations of our email exchanges; we had gotten outo
					of touch for some period of time, but were able to regain communication.</p>

					<h4>11/13/16: First Email Exchange (Vanika)</h4> <p> Hi Saikripa, <br> <br> My 
					name is Vanika Hans, and I am currently a Junior at CU Boulder, as well as a member 
					of the ELP program. It has been quite a while, but I believe you were assigned as my 
					mentor for the YAM program, and I was hoping to reach out to you and see if you are 
					still interested. I have many questions and would love to get to know you! <br> 
					Please let me know if you are interested, and then perhaps we can figure out a means of communication (coffee, skype, etc).
					<br>Thank you! Look forward to hearing back.</p>
					
					<h4>11/18/16: First time I Heard Back (Sai)</h4> <p> Hi Vanika! It's great to hear from you. I would love to be your mentor and answer your questions. 
					What are some days that are good for you? We can either meet in person or on Skype depending on the day.<br>
					How's school going so far? Are you enjoying your major and CU? We can talk more about this when we talk! <br>
					Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
					
					<h4><bold> 01/29/17: (Vanika)</h4> <p>Hope you've been well! I wanted to reach out to you and see how you are doing! I think we need to find a better means of communication instead
					of over email, as I am very prone to reading emails and never looking back again, haha! <br> That being said, it would be great if you could send me a text at 7192293381 whenever you get a chance. <br>
					School is going well! Junior year is...well, Junior Year. I'm taking some pretty great classes, though, and I'm very much looking forward to what Spring Semester will entail! How about you? What are 
					you up to these days? You've graduated from CU, right?</p> 
					
					<h4>02/22/17: (Vanika)</h4> <p> How is everything going? I heard from Ang that you are currently pursuing Med School, which is totally AWESOME.
					Are you attending CU's school, or did you branch off to another organization? I had a few questions to ask you, mainly to get to know you 
					since we haven't had quite yet had the chance to have a discussion. (Also, since it has been a while since we've talked, please let me know
					if you're still able to be a YAM mentor! I'd appreciate any time you have to give. :) ) <br> 
					1. Were there any activities or communities on campus that you especially admired or enjoyed when you were a student? <br>
					2. What were the most rewarding things you did as a college student, outside of the classroom? What made these so rewarding? <br>
					3. Do you see any needs in the community that might be opportunities for someone like me to make a difference? <br>
					4. When you were a student on campus, did you take on any leadership roles or make a difference in ways that make you proud? <br>
					5. Do you have any suggestions for how I can do an especially effective job brainstorming? <br>
					If you have any other notes to add on, I'd love to hear it. Thanks so much, and have a great rest of your day! <br></p>
					<br>
					<h4>...After a long hiatus during which it was found that Sai changed her email...</h4>
					<br>
					<h4>09/29/17: (Vanika)</h4><p>I hope you've been well! Looks like Ang reached out to you last April, and I was able to get your updated 
					email address. I'm so glad I'll be able to hopefully connect with an actual Sai now, haha! <br> How are you? Where are you now, after graduation? 
					Are you pursuing a Master's degree, or are you working? <br> I'm currently in my Senior Year  as an Electrical Engineer, starting off the Controls 
					Track, and doing a Capstone project (we're making a Smart Cane!) This summer, I did a pretty cool internship at Intel up in Fort Collins, and will 
					be going to the bigger office in Hillsboro for a full-time after graduation! I'm very excited about it, but also a little nervous as I've been in 
					Colorado my whole life, and I'm not totally ready to move away from my family. <br>I'm currently taking COEN 3052, which is basically a Leadership 
					Class geared towards organizing a Leadership Experience! What did you do for your Leadership Experience? <br> I'd love to set up a Skype Call so we 
					can actually communicate! Haha. Let me know what your availability in the next few weeks will be. Looking forward to hearing back. :) </p>
					
					<h4>9/29/17: (Sai)</h4> <p>Yeah! I'm so glad you got the right email. Congrats on becoming a senior! That's a really big deal :) <br> 
					I am in medical school right now here in Colorado. It's not exactly engineering, but I am loving everything that I am learning. I actually worked in 
					Houston doing an engineering job for a year after graduation, so if you are nervous about moving out and want to hear about my experience, I would love
					to share it. <br> That Capstone project seems awesome! Is a Smart Cane for medical purposes? Regardless, good luck. The Capstone is exactly that; it is a 
					reflection on everything you learned in the past 3 years, and it is really fun. <br> I am not familiar with that class, unfortunately! I don't know if that 
					program was around when I was in college. But, if there is anything I can do to help you, definitely let me know! <br> I would also love to Skype or talk 
					on the phone or anything really! Let me know what times you are free!</p>
					
					<h4>10/29/17: (Vanika)</h4> <p>Thank you!!! <br> That is really cool! Where did you work? And what inspired you to apply to medical school? Also, where 
					do you go now - do you attend Anshutz? Also, that would be amazing if you could share your experience. What was going through your mind as you were finishing 
					up your degree knowing you were headed to Houston? What were some challenges you encountered after making the move? Were these challenges an accurate representation
					of the reality you experienced there? <br>  Thank you! Yes, it is kind of, I guess! It's more geared towards advancing the basic blind cane. But we hope that our sponsor 
					will adapt our prototype and implement this to those that may benefit in Dubai. What project did you do? I think I vaguely recall something about a rickshaw project...was 
					that you? I remember that it was mentioned at an ELP Seminar way back! <br> Sure, sounds great! Sorry about the spread apart emails, by the way. I have this awful 
					habit of reading emails immediately and not responding, which then I remember like wayyyy later. But, perhaps either of those mediums (Skype or phone call) might be better. :)
					Will you have any time next Monday for a conversation? <br> Also: I had a few other questions for you if you have a chance to respond (so so many questions in this email! 
					We can also address these during our Skype call. haha!) <br> 1) My Leadership Experience is going to be to organize a Networking Event for SWE. I organized the Networking Night
					event this last month, which had about 78 student attendees as well as about 25 industry representatives involved. It was an incredible experience, but I'm using 
					that as a precursor/practice run for the real deal this upcoming Spring. Do you have any experience in organizing large-scale events like this? If so, do you have any advice? <br>
					2) My particular goals for the ELP portfolio are to successfully integrate STEM and a better understanding of Industry to current CU Students (more specifically to SWE since I am 
					the VP), as well as to have a good capstone group experience. Are these something you think are specific enough/too ambitious/not ambitious enough? <br> Thank you so much for all 
					of your future help. I am very much looking forward to our mentoring relationship - I hope that I can also help provide some reflection on your experiences a few years ago as we 
					continue to discuss things you experienced in the past. <br> </p>	
					
					<h4>11/2/17: (Sai) </h4> <p>Hey Vanika! <br> This is perfect, how about we talk on Monday night (7-8pm)? Does that work for you? <br> And then, I can answer
					these questions, cause I hate typing; but these are excellent questions and I want to make sure that I answer them! </p>
					
					<h4> 02/10/18: (Vanika) </h4> <p>Hi Sai, Hope you've been well. I do want to apologize that I'm awful at replying to your emails, honestly every time I reach out to you, I am
					fully confident that we'll set up a time to talk, and then life gets crazy and my mind goes everywhere - leaving your email read but not replied to! This is something I'm 
					really trying to work on this semester, I have lots of things I want to accomplish but a really unorganized way of doing it! <br> Anyways, I am reaching out to you in hopes of 
					setting up a Skype call sometime this or next week. Let me know your availability this week/next week, and hopefully we can finally set something up.<br> </p>
				
					<h4> 02/12/18: (Sai) </h4> <p> I'm free on Wednesday and Friday after 7 pm. Otherwise, if there are other times that you prefer, let me know! </p>
					
					<h4> *** More coordination *** </h4>
					
					<h4> 02/17/18: Skype Call </h4> <p> In this call, after an extremely convoluted time spent talking over email, the following is a list of things that we were able to talk about: <br>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Received some advice on stress management. Sai suggested that next time I'm stressed, that I can try making a list of my morals/values in that moment. She also suggested I can make a list of what I can do about the situation, and then choosing what's easiest to accomplish.</li>
						<li>Briefly discussed a situation with my Capstone Group that involved a new experience for me. Sai mentioned here that I acted in a graceful manner, and gave an example of how I could have unprofessionally acted. It was great to get some perspective on this from someone that is not currently in Capstone! </li>
						<li>Talked about Oregon and big life changes for me on the way. Sai talked about how it took her like a few weeks to get adjusted, but everyone had really low expectations for her when she first started working, so it was a good way to adjust. 
						She also mentioned that living alone at her apartment when she first moved was a little bit lonely sometimes, but that she'd be happy to 
						share her experience with it.</li>
						<li>Brought up the Retreat that I need to complete for COEN 3050. Sai provided some great ideas for this! She recommended
making it like a picnic for herself, like basically to have it as a day of self-reflection, and watching TED talks. </li>
						<li>Got to actually know her better! Sai mentioned that it is her third year of med school, where the first two were extremely textbook-like, and all of a sudden a lot changed! We had some discussion here

						<li>Made plans to chat in the future! We plan to talk once a month, including after graduation. We also exchanged numbers, as to not just rely on emailing each other with very slow replies.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4> Rest of April </h4> <p> Since Sai and I had a late start to our mentoring due to issues with emails, 
					Sai agreed to continue mentoring me after I graduate. I am very lucky to have someone so committed to mentoring!
					So our conversations will continue. </p>
-->					
					<a name="advice"></a>
					<h6 style ="color:white;"> . </h6>
				
					<h2>Empowering Advice </h2>
					<p>So far, the biggest piece of advice I've gotten from Sai is the methods by which I can deal with stress, as well as her suggestions based on her experiences living alone in a brand new city. For instance,
					she suggested a logical approach to stressful situations, and after experiences a few of these after interacting with her, I really found it useful to break down stressful situations and divide and conquer the easiest first. 
					As for living alone, she gave some tips how to survive doing this, such as things like always having background music going around in the background.</p>
					
					<a name="example"> </a>
					<h6 style ="color:white;"> . </h6>
					<p>  </p>
					<h2>Leadership by Example </h2>
					<p> Sai has inspired me to not be limited in what the future holds by a degree. For instance, after getting through chemical engineering, she went on to pursue
					med school, which she described as much harder than what she was used to since it's an "Arts-and-sciences" way of thinking. But, this doesn't hold her back.
					This has inspired me to look in other fields for a future career, and really be a leader of my own life. </p>
					<p> Sai also inspired me to not be intimidated by people older than me in the workplace. For instance, she talked about how as a medical student, there are people
					of all ages, and how she learned to work with people much older. When talking about her experiences in med school, Sai comes off as not only very flexible and well-adjusted,
					but also confident. There are characteristics I would like to demonstrate down the road. </p>
					
					<a name="gratitude"> </a>
					<h6 style ="color:white;"> . </h6>
					<h2>Letter of Gratitude</h2>
					<p>Dear Sai, </p>
					<p>Although we did not have a chance to connect much early on, thank you so much for taking the time to be my ELP mentor. Although so far we have only had a single Skype
					call besides the text messages and emails, I find that our conversations are very genuine and not superficial whatsoever, which is very valuable to me. Thank you for 
					your openness and willingness to talk about your life experiences, mistakes you've made, and how you've gotten to be where you are now. Thank you also giving me advice on different
					experiences in my life, and for being such a huge help in transitioning from collegiate to career. I look forward to continuing a relationship with you after graduation.</p>
					<p>Warm Regards, <br> Vanika</p>

					<h1>ELP Seminar Speakers</h1>
					<h2>Jamais Cascio • Conference on World Affairs Speaker • April 6, 2016</h2>
					<p>Jamais Cascio is a professional futurist: NOT a predictor, as he may add. Cascio is an extremely unique individual, in the sense that not only is his career something I hadn't heard of prior to, but it involves a
					skillset that most, if not all of us, should develop to some extent. Cascio's occupation involves predicting and considering different possibilities that humankind could be faced with, in addition to laying out possible 
					solutions. Interestingly, these "possibilities" refer to future conflicts, which aren't limited to physical possibilities, but also to common ethical practices.</p>
					<p>The one that stuck out to me in particular was the discussion involving brain uploading. It wasn't so much this topic that got me, but after Cascio discussed the several points of views on this topic, I realized that there really is no direct answer to these ethical problems. There are thousands of possibilities for where humankind can go, especially with the level of intelligence that we have achieved in our current century. Not only is it then terrifying, but also extremely pressuring, that each and every decision we make affects our future generations. </p>
					<p>To write this reflection, I purposefully waited as long as possible to see truly what the long-term outcomes were from this discussion. What I have determined is that Cascio's discussion really made me aware of who I am as an individual, where with the evolving world there becomes more and more ethical responsibility. However, with this responsibility comes the opportunity to further educate myself about each and every problem, in addition to hearing and taking into account other people's views on these opinions.</p>
					<p>The "skills" I referred to earlier are exactly what Cascio's discussion instilled I should learn. The skills break down into the following. First, we all need to develop this aptitude to even question these difficult questions. MANY of the individuals I know tend to run away from issues in their lives, and avoiding these moral issues are going to be extremely harmful to our future. Secondly, we must develop the skillset to truly question everything: why do we think the way we do about everything? How can we change that? And, finally: we must develop the confidence and skillset to handle these issues, as well as the capacity to hear contradicting perspectives.</p>
					<p>My takeway from this seminar had very less to do with what Cascio was discussing, but more so the holistic implications of the things he was discussing. Cascio's discussion really opened my eyes to where I am in my engineering degree, where all of the world I will be doing in just a couple years will actually be affecting so much more.</p>
					<h2>Danielle Feinberg • Pixar Animation Studios • November 1, 2017</h2>
					<p>Danielle Feinberg, a Boulder High School Alumni, presented on the intertwining of science and coding while working at Pixar Studios. Danielle specializes in lighting, which means that not only does her job title require an in-depth knowledge of physics, but also the capability to bring these concepts to life through programming and the creativity to make these features visually pleasing and effective in showing the audience a story. Danielle made it very clear in her presentation that her job in lighting isn't to recreate the world that we see, but to create a world that we can believe. </p>
					<p>Danielle's discussion was very inspiring in many ways. What stood out most to me most was that her passion in life is so specific - lighting in animation. As a college student taking classes of many, many different topics, finding a specific niche of where I belong as an engineer is definitely a challenge. In Danielle's experience, although it may seem like a random specialty, she was only able to find her love for lighting in Disney movies by going out and learning about it. I aspire to be a leader in my life and go out to seek a passion that combines my interests altogether in a single job, just like Danielle who is using her love for art, computers, and science every single day. </p>
					<h2>John Holdren • Dean's Speaker Series • November 16, 2017</h2>
					<p>John Holdren has been the longest science advisor in history. Hearing him speak was very ground-breaking to me, as he made it a point to encourage those pursuing engineering to consider science/energy policy as a career, which is something I hadn't even considered. Holdren had started off as an Aerospace Engineering, and moved into the science/energy policy world years later. He claimed that his job was "never boring." <br> <br> The 3 major responsibilities in his job were to manage:<p>
					<ul>
						<li>"Science and Technology for the Policy" which entailed making sure that the president has information on what science and engineering say about the issues for economic policy, defense policy, etc.</li>
						<li>"Policy for Science and Technology" which was working with the agencies and Office of Budget to plan out what the budgets are going to be for different initiatives, working with congress to appropriate the budget, and working to see how the federal government "can advance the ball" in regard to IP rights, immigration policy, arctic initiatives, energy, etc.  </li>
						<li>"President's ambassador for congress and countries around the world," which is pretty self-explanatory.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>He also talked further about working with Obama, and claimed that "Obama was the most science-savvy president since Thomas Jefferson." He mentioned that Obama really understood that science, technology, innovation, and engineering matter for EVERYTHING (specifically all issues on the national agenda). This includes the economy, public health, climate change, energy, national security, and more. Obama was very interested in using Science and Technology to move forward. Holdren also mentioned that oftentimes Obama would ask baffling questions to the advisors, and send advisors off to figure it out. Holdren also talked about how oftentimes Obama would make his unhappiness well-known without raising his voice, which would "make you feel like you've let him down," which I found very interesting as many leaders can get loud when frustrated, but this sort of emotional disappointment actually says so much about how Obama connected with his staff. Lastly, he talked about how Obama was the type of leader to sit with his Nobel Laureattes; his relationship with his staff was not "corporate" or hierarchal.</p>
					<p>Some current initiatives from the Obama administration (not sure what "current" refers to here) are: the Brain initiative and the Precision medicine initiative. The former refers to combatting antibiotic resistance, which in retrospect is a prominent issue effecting all kinds of medical advancements. The latter is to create an intersection between genomics, big data analytics, and public health records.</p>
					<p>When asked about in today's era of distrust of the validity of science, "how can we get better at showing others the vital importance of science data to the society?" Holdren responded that we need to get good at telling stories about why science and technology matter. An example of this is when lasers were invented, the person who created it didn't know at the time that his invention would be used for eye surgery, showing videos, etc. We have to demonstrate good stories.</p>
					<h2>Dr. Mae Jemison • Leo HIll Leadership Speaker Series • February 27, 2018</h2>
					<p>I've never heard a woman speak so confidently about herself and achievements. Learning about Dr. Mae Jemison from the mouth of Dr. Mae Jemison was a very unique experience. She started off her talk giving us the following quote: "Don't Doubt, Dare" also saying that "It's not by being timid that we get places." </p>
					<p>Jemison described herself with five different attributes:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Astronaut </li>
					<li>Engineer </li>
					<li>Entrepreneur</li>
					<li>Physician </li>
					<li>Education</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Jemison described herself growing up at a time when so much was changing. During 1960 there was great deal of change regarding women's rights, social change, etc. She mentioned that there were "long, hot summers" after the MLK assassination. Growing up, she had a wide array of interests including dance, fashion, space, math, and archeology. After attending Stanford University at the age of 16 for Chemical Engineering and African Studies and Cornell for Med school she became an astronaut at NASA, and went on later to become the leader of the 100 Years Mission. She has even been an actor.</p> 
					<p>What I loved about her discussion is the fact that she called a simple cell phone a "space receiver." Is that not incredible? Something so basic that literally everyone in the tech world has next to them at all times is a piece of technology based off of the space industry technology.</p>
					<p>An extremely significant part of Jemison's presentation was an exercise organized to determine the decisions we would make in building something new. For instance, in this theoretical innovation in regards to health, should we use 3D printed replacement parts or in situ rejuvenation (self-healing)? In regards to clothing, what fabric should we use? For technology, should we use silicon or steam punk? For Status enroute should we use Hibernation/suspended animation or awake generations? For food, should we use vegetarian or meat? For Work, should we use individual or assigned based on aptitude tests? After discussing this theoretical innovation for some time, the end point was that the challenges of interstellar travel mirrors the challenges that we face in the world today. SO POWERFUL. It was such a plot twist.</p>		
					<p>Some quotes that really stood out to me were: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>"You don't have to choose one [interest], the breadth of knowledge is what matters." </li>
						<li>"Even the sharpest blade can't cut its own handle." (Unless you have a wide range of skills, your usefulness may be diminished.) </li>
						<li>Space is thinking about the way we can change our world, not just about rockets and propulsion.</li>
						<li>"Coming out of college, you should still be learning and doing MANY other things beyond getting a good knowledge base.</li>
						<li>"I suggest pursuing the extraordinary."</li>

					<h1>ELP Mentoring</h1>
					<p> In addition to receiving an immense amount of mentoring from my ELP mentor and the ELP Seminar Speakders, I was also able to give back to the community
					and provide ELP mentoring of my own during my time as a Toon Leader. I had the opportunity to organize a Toon for a group of 6 students alongside another Toon 
					Leader. In addition to discussing in-depth about the topics covered in class, we had set a goal for our Toon to ensure that we would be well-rounded. Thus, we
					provided some opportunities to eat together, explore the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, etc. This was a great experience, as I was able to form
					close relationships with my mentees, and really advise them not only on ELP items such as planning a Leadership Experience, but also how to do well in the college of 
					Engineering, as well.

					<h1>Others Impacting My Journey</h1>
					<h2>An Unexpected Mentor </h2>
					<p>The word "mentor" has an authoritative connotation; a mentor implies someone that knows exactly what they are doing, associated with the "been there done that" mentality. I think of some old man with a long, white beard, who lives in a cave; he spent his life achieving the impossible, and now lives to advise others with reference to his path. To me, that mentor is not a true mentor, because if they have already reached the end of their path, they are on an entirely different level than I am. Their perspective is not relatable, because they have overcome the difficulties and now, with a calm attitude, reminisce.  My definition of a mentor is someone that definitely has overcome similar experiences to me, but has also overcome these experiences recent enough to have a perspective that is relevant to me. </p>
					<p>That being said, a very prominent mentor in my life has been a classmate of mine. This individual is actually an upperclassman in an entirely different field of engineering. Our paths crossed due to his ambitious pursual of an electrical engineering minor, in addition to an already rigorous mechanical engineering major. Thus, we met in a lab environment. </p>
					<p>It amazes me to work with this individual, as regardless of the issues encountered, he diligently and confidently works to solve issues. There is no negativity, just a few jokes and then focused work. He does not even have electrical engineering classes to base his knowledge off of, just the singular prerequisite for the class and a great attitude. Not only does his work ethic fascinate me, but also, his willingness to help others is also extremely commendable. There will be instances where my third lab partner does not understand the hardware aspect of our robot, where he will have no problem jumping in and troubleshooting, and when I have issues with the simulation aspect of the project, he will also equally jump in and answer any of my questions. Somehow, he manages to keep a great attitude at all times, and with this attitude excels. I am extremely lucky to have him as a lab partner, but more as a friend. My mentor doesn't even know he is my mentor. </p>
					<p>In the short time we have worked together, he has already taught me so much. I have really learned the importance of keeping a chill attitude and focusing on the larger goal than the small details. He has taught me the importance and advantage of jumping into tasks whether or whether not there is a plan. Good leaders should be humble, and through his selfless actions I have really learned how that attitude keeps a good dynamic. But, besides teaching me the importance of these leadership qualities, he has also made it possible for me to even execute these activities, as ideally stating what leaders should do is different than how it actually turns out in action. </p>
					<p>As mentioned before, another aspect of this that has made him so important in my life is the relatability. He is a student, just like me, and yet his feats have proved him capable of achieving so much. I really feel inspired as a leader, because I know that one day, if I follow his path, I will be able to achieve just the same.</p>
					<p>This has been important to me as a leader because I have seen exactly who I want to be in 3 years. After accumulating years worth of engineering knowledge, I strive to be an asset to the community in the way that he is. Given that I generally do not base my self-judgment off of my peers (but more of this idealistic version of what I can be), I am actually my own worst enemy; thus, this comparison, or more, reverence for another person is incredibly significant to my self-development, as both a leader and contributing member of future society.</p>
					
					<h2>ELP (COEN 3052) Small Group Reflections</h2>
					<h3>Small Group Reflection 1 </h3>
					<ul>
						<li> To celebrate:
							<ul>
							<li> I made it through organizing a Networking Night! This was basically a result of whatever leadership skills I currently have, before going through this course and working on my leadership development. </li>
							<li> I achieved:
								<ul> 
									<li>Good comments on my speaking skills during the presentation.</li>
									<li>Good emailing and communication with coordinating companies attending.</li>
									<li>Good organization/time management on my side.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
						<li> A challenge:
							<ul>
								<li>Distributing workload.</li>
									<ul>
										<li> I had a hard time ensuring that jobs were evenly distributed, and I ended up coordinating a lot of the work myself. </li>
										<li> The event was very much me running around, but I should have asked some of the other SWE officers to help out more! In the future, I need to better ask for help. </li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Insights from Research:
							<ul>
								<li> I found a schedule I can follow for organizing the next event! That way it will be better organized. </li>
								<li> I found some different strategies to promote the event better: this will help in organizing a large group of people. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Insights from Small Group:
							<ul> 
								<li>Tell people your standard - don't expect for people to "just know."</li>
								<li>Check in with your group members every 2 weeks.</li>
								<li>Use Google Calendar to communicate deadlines.</li>
								<li>Ask for feedback.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Small Group Reflection 2 </h3>
					<p>For this small group gathering, I had a great time seeing the progression of everyone’s project planning. It was very interesting to see some of the students discuss how they got through a problem they had talked about at the last meeting, and it was also great to see some familiar faces in ELP. </p>
					<p>The main question/difficulty that I wanted to get some advice on was how to get people involved in joining a committee to plan the event. I wasn’t really sure how to incentivize it to engineering college students that already have so less time, and so some of the ideas I got were to advertise the committee as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A resume builder. </li>
						<li>An opportunity to get priority in deciding which company representatives come.</li>
						<li>A free networking event – committee members don’t have to pay! </li>	
						<li> An opportunity to fill the Professional Development requirement for SWE.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> This was very helpful, as I was able to get an idea of what people might look for when deciding to become involved with a committee. I will use this information to garner people to join the committee after the holidays. </p>
