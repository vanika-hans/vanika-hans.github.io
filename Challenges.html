					<h1>ELP Coursework Reflections</h1>
					<br>
					
					<h3>1. Engineering Leadership Gateway</h3>
					<p>This course was a very significant part of my college career. To be totally honest, before this course, I wasn't really sure where I stood in engineering, or very much so if I even wanted to do it. After taking this course at the same time as other technical courses, the discussions in this course regarding leadership (especially Ender's Game) really affirmed that whatever I do, I want to be a leader doing it. Of course, leadership is taken but earned, but I at least had a sense of desire to further pursue my leadership studies and apply myself as a leader in my further college experiences. This class was also quite wonderful as everyone was so nice and friendly, and even till today years later I still see some of the people I had classes with around campus!</p>

					<br>
					
					<h3>2. Greek and Roman Comedy (HUMN 4130)</h3>
					<p>Before taking this class, I had said that "although it's not directly related towards Leadership, I feel that [this class] will also touch on some of the topics Scot Douglass covered in Critical Encounters, relating to social/political/economic realities of Athens/Rome impacted by Rome's military influence, not to mention criticism of society and the self."</p>
					<p>Looking back now, this class did a whole lot for my leadership experience, completely different than I had thought coming in. The list of comedies we had read are below:</p>
					<ol>
					<i><b>
					<li>Brown, P. Menander: The Plays and Fragments (2008)</li>
					<li>Christenson, C. Captivi, etc. (2008) </li>
					<li>Halliwell, S. Aristophanes: Birds and Other Plays (2009) </li>
					<li>MacDowell, D.M. Aristophanes and Athens. An Introduction to the Plays (1995) </li>
					<li>Segal, E. Plautus: Four Comedies (2008) </li>
					<li>Storey, I. and A. Allan, A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama (2005)</li>
					</ol>
					</i></b>
					<p>Superfically, Besides learning a great deal about Greek and Roman culture (for instance, we somehow spent a great amount of time learning about phalluses, brothels, and other topics that would really not be discussed in a traditional classroom setting), 
					I learned a lot about how these many plays were the start of many modern-day sitcoms (such as Seinfield!). I also was able to read social and political comedies written by three of the greats: Aristophanes, Menander, and Plautus. Adding onto this, we talked a lot about the nature of comedy itself, in terms of what comedy tells us about a society in terms of hopes, fears, and prejudices.</p>
					<p>On a deeper level in regard to my own leadership experience, the biggest outcome from this class was a fresh perspective of what the world outside of engineering/technical courses looks like. This may sound surprising to write about for an engineering leadership certificate, but in retrospect the timing that I took this class really allowed me to get some perspective on the degree I am pursuing. Specifically, after spending 5 semesters straight of taking technical courses (summer and spring/fall) in both Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and deciding on Electrical Engineering, and constantly taking classes to catch up, this course provided a second to step back and understand what I'm really pursuing engineering for. What does engineering have in common with comedy? Not much, engineers don't make jokes (just kidding). However, through the discussions of what comedy tells us about a society, I was able to get a concrete idea of the society engineering is working to serve really is. And, in fact, talking about the people that engineering is looking to serve actually made it more appealing to me. Something about the talks in this class really provided a fresh life perspective of humanity and what we stand for, the entertainment that we seek, and who we are as a race. This really impassioned my desire to pursue engineering, and that, too, become a leader in it.</p>
					<p>As for leadership skills, the Professor in this class did a great job of gearing class discussions to get students involved during an Augmester course; it was very interesting to see how this professor worked to engage the students through interesting/random things like phalluses as mentioned above, but also how the professor was able to get people to be involved in class discussion. This course is also part of the reason why I ended up taking School and Society for my second Leadership Elective.</p>

					<br>
					
					<h3>3. School and Society (EDUC 3013)</h3>
					<p>The first leadership elective I chose to take was School & Society (EDUC 3013). My intention in taking this course directly towards my leadership studies was to learn how to be a leader in what I've spent all of my life doing - learning. I took this class with the intention to learn about education, and how I can in the future apply these issues to teaching. As a leader, it is extremely important to become educated about the issue you are trying to resolve. At the time that I took this class, I was very frustrated with the quality of education I was receiving in specific courses, as in many cases not only was a lot of knowledge assumed that was never taught, but I was not happy with the lack of diverse learning types and backgrounds unaccounted for in teaching. For instance, the fact that I am a female in engineering seemed to impact the quality of education I was receiving in regards to asking questions to professors and receiving answers, forming study groups amongst peers, and even completing projects as the men would usually take control of things related to hardware. Further, at this time period, I was serving as the Director of Outreach as part of SWE (Society of Women Engineers), and was very interested in learning about different teaching practices I could implement at the time.</p>
					<p>The following is a brief overview of readings and authors we covered in this class:</p>
					<ol>
					<i><b>
					<li>Segregation and inequality, Outsider vs. Insider Views of East St. Louis Schools - Kozol, Berliner & Biddle, Farmer-Hinton, Rothstein & Santow</li>
					<li>Class bias across schools/neighborhoods; reproduction of capitalism- Jean Anyon</li>
					<li>Tracking inside schools as form of social bias, discrimination - Jeannie Oakes</li>
					<li>Racial bias, racism, white privilege in society, Modelling the Minority Stereotype (how Asians are perceived in schooling and the different categories that exist unaccounted for) - Beverly Tatum, Peggy McIntosh</li>
					<li>Curriculum & pedagogy, how to teach, tradition vs. progressive teaching methodologies - Hirsch, Alfie Kohn, John Dewey, Paulo Freire</li>
					<li>Education policies – ESEA (Title 1), NCLB (accountability/testing), ESSA, Common Core, charter schools, vouchers, privatization (i.e., control of schools by for-profit groups/organizations/business model of management)</li>
					<li>Ethical Dilemma, Zero Tolerance policies  – Levinson and Fay (2016)</li>
					</i></b>
					</ol>
					<p>Though this class, I also had the opportunity to learn a great deal about writing ethical communities and arguing my position in several class discussions.</p>

					<br>
					
					<h3>4. COEN 3051</h3>
					<p>I really liked the self-pacing of this course! It was kind of nice to be able to complete the leadership development in this class on my own time, and not just because an assignment deadline was coming. I would say, however, it was a little difficult to know what was expected from the course by just reading through the syllabus and looking at the Dropbox. It would be nice if we could have an orientation or something at the start of the semester so that everyone knows what the deliverables will be at the end of the semester.</p>
					<p>This was a really good start to leadership development on my own, though, as in the past it was basically just class discussions in Gateway and random thoughts in my leadership electives, but this was a great way to formalize the experience.</p>
					<br>

					<h3>5. COEN 3052</h3>
					<p>This course was very helpful in planning my leadership experience! It was honestly this course that really helped walk me through planning everything and to stay motivated in making the event happen. It was also great to have someone directly track what I was working on with my leadership experience so I could get feedback and guidance on my first time planning a huge event like I did. I also very much felt a better sense of community taking this course than the previous classes, as I was able to make friends with the familiar faces I saw at the small group gathering meetings.</p>
					<br>

					<h3>6. COEN 3053</h3>
					<p>The final course in ELP was a very helpful experience in wrapping up my leadership studies and reflecting on everything I've been doing. It has truly been a great experience looking back and seeing all that I've done!</p>
